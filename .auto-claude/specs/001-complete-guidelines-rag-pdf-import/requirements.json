  "task_description": "# Complete Guidelines RAG PDF Import\n\nImplement the full PDF import pipeline for Czech medical guidelines, including document parsing, chunking, embedding generation, and storage in the vector database. Enable reliable retrieval of guideline content for AI responses.\n\n## Rationale\nCzech doctors need access to local clinical guidelines - this is a critical gap that general AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) cannot address. Evidence-based recommendations require proper guideline citations.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an admin, I want to upload Czech medical guideline PDFs so that doctors can search this content\n- As a doctor, I want to see which guideline a recommendation comes from so that I can verify the source\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] PDF documents can be uploaded via admin endpoint\n- [ ] Documents are parsed, chunked, and embedded in vector database\n- [ ] Chunks maintain source metadata (document name, page number)\n- [ ] At least 3 different guideline formats are supported\n- [ ] Import progress and errors are properly logged",
