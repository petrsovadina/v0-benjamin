All issues were related to missing implementation patterns that would be critical for successful implementation: explicit dependency list, vitest.config.ts with React plugin, vitest.setup.ts content, and pyproject.toml structure. Technical accuracy was verified against Context7 documentation - package names, API patterns (userEvent.setup(), screen.getByRole()), and framework versions (Next.js 16.0.7, React 19.2.0) all match the actual project and research findings.",
