Enable reliable retrieval of guideline content for AI responses.\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCzech doctors need access to local clinical guidelines - this is a critical gap that general AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) cannot address. Evidence-based recommendations require proper guideline citations.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n- As an admin, I want to upload Czech medical guideline PDFs so that doctors can search this content\\n- As a doctor, I want to see which guideline a recommendation comes from so that I can verify the source\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n- [ ] PDF documents can be uploaded via admin endpoint\\n- [ ] Documents are parsed, chunked, and embedded in vector database\\n- [ ] Chunks maintain source metadata (document name, page number)\\n- [ ] At least 3 different guideline formats are supported\\n- [ ] Import progress and errors are properly logged\\n\",\n  \"scoped_services\": [],\n  \"files_to_modify\": [],\n  \"files_to_reference\": [],\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-12-24T03:15:33.805608\"\n}",
